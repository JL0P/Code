# THESIS CODE
This repository contains a collection of MATLAB and Python scripts for EPANET-based dataset generation, neural network tuning (network structure + regularization), and sensor pruning based on learned weights. The workflow is divided into steps, each with its own script/notebook, as discussed in my thesis and in [1].
The workflow is divided into steps, each with its own script/notebook. Below is an overview of how to set up and run them.
